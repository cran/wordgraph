Title: Graph Functionality of Free Associated Words
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Epaminondas Diamantopoulos
Maintainer: Epaminondas Diamantopoulos <epdiamantopoulos@yahoo.gr>
Description: Functions that help less experienced R users to make graph analysis for free associated words, or more generally for repeated nominal data for which a undirected graph analysis is meaningful. By corresponding to each word its centrality, it is possible to apply standard quantitative analysis methods in order to associate word selection with other   variables.
    The functions are implemented with the aid of the 'tibble', 'tidygraph', 'ggraph' and 'ggplot2' packages. Supported centrality functions are centrality_alpha(), centrality_authority(), centrality_betweenness(), centrality_closeness(), centrality_pagerank(), centrality_eigen(). A data set is included.
