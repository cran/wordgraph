\description{
Data that were collected in a research study on social representations. The participants were given a stimulus word regarding eight different life experiences (Diet, Exercise, Smoking, Alcoholic beverage, Nightlife, Lifestyle, Disease and Health) and asked to express three consecutively words associated with the stimulus word. Age, gender, marital status (married) and educational level (secondary) was also recorded. The nine Symptom Check List (SCL - 90R) psychopathology subscales are also administered and included in the data. Permission to make data publicly available was granted from Professor Mary Gouva.
